# Serial Depepdence in the perception of proportion
This repository contains the python scripts and behavioral data proposed in

### Experiment 1
- data: recorded data
- run_all_analysis.py: reproduce figures in our manuscript
- preprocess_outlier_removal.py: data cleaning and preprocessing
- response_repetition.py: Analyzes the probability of repeating the same response as in the previous trial
- selected_white_dot_ratio.py: Analyzes the mean proportion of “more white dots” responses across participants
- accuracy_by_white_dot_prop.py: Analyzes overall accuracy across participants for each white-dot proportion
- accuracy_by_condition.py: Analyzes overall accuracy across participants for each condition
- pse_by_condition.py: Analyzes PSE in each consition
- pse_mean_diff_by_lag.py: Analyzes mean differences in the PSE at different lags (1-back, 2-back, and 3-back)
